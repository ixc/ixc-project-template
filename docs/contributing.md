# Contributing

Please follow these guidelines when making contributions to this project.

## Getting Started

Get the code and setup a virtualenv:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ixc/<project_name>.git
    $ cd <project_name>
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the tests:

    # All environments, just the given environments, or just the virtualenv.
    (venv)$ tox
    (venv)$ tox -e django17-py27,django18-py27
    (venv)$ ./manage.py test

Run the project interactively:

    (venv)$ ./manage.py migrate
    (venv)$ ./manage.py runserver

## Git

We are using the [Gitflow branching model]. Basically:

  * The `master` branch always contains production ready code, and each commit
    represents a release to production.
  * The `develop` branch serves as an integration branch for new features, and
    is merged into `master` when we are ready to tag a new release.
  * New features are developed in `feature/*` branches. Create a pull request
    when you are ready to merge a feature branch back into `develop`.

The [SourceTree] app (OS X and Windows) has built-in support for Gitflow, and
there is also a collection of [git-extensions] for command line users.

## Code Style

It's important that we all adopt a consistent code style to minimise code churn
and make collaboration easier.

  * Follow [PEP8] for Python code, unless there is a good reason not to.
  * Install the [EditorConfig] plugin for your preferred code editor.

## Documentation

Docs are probably more important than tests!

  * Write [Markdown] docs for all notable changes and additions.
  * Include examples so new contributors can get started quickly.
  * Include rationale when there are competing solutions, so people know why
    they should use our solution.
  * Keep the [changelog] up to date. Use plain language to describe changes,
    as it may be read by people who are not as familiar with the project or a
    particular feature as you.

## Tests

We don't need 100% test coverage, but we should at least have:

  * Unit tests for all regression bugs.
  * Unit or integration tests for complex, fragile, or important functionality.

## Releases

  * When the changelog for a release gets sufficiently long (half a page to a
    page) or major features or fixes are implemented, tag a release.
