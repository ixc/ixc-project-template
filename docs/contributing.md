# Contributing

Please follow these guidelines when making contributions to this project.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and change directory:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ixc/<project_name>.git
    $ cd <project_name>

You don't need to install the project to run tests. You just need `tox`:

    $ pip install -U tox
    $ tox  # All environments.
    $ tox -e django{17,18}-py27  # Given environments.

If the project dependencies have been updated, rebuild the test environment:

    $ tox -r
    $ tox -e django17-py27 -r

If you want to run and test the project interactively, follow the
[installation] docs.

## Git

We are using the [Gitflow branching model]. Basically:

  * The `master` branch always contains production ready code, and each commit
    represents a release to production.
  * The `develop` branch serves as an integration branch for new features, and
    is merged into `master` when we are ready to tag a new release.
  * New features are developed in `feature/*` branches. Create a pull request
    when you are ready to merge a feature branch back into `develop`.

The [SourceTree] app (OS X and Windows) has built-in support for Gitflow, and
there is also a collection of [git-extensions] for command line users.

## Code Style

It's important that we all adopt a consistent code style to minimise code churn
and make collaboration easier.

  * Follow [PEP8] for Python code, unless there is a good reason not to.
  * Install the [EditorConfig] plugin for your preferred code editor.

## Documentation

Docs are probably more important than tests!

  * Write [Markdown] docs for all notable changes and additions.
  * Include examples so new contributors can get started quickly.
  * Include rationale when there are competing solutions, so people know why
    they should use our solution.
  * Keep the [changelog] up to date. Use plain language to describe changes,
    as it may be read by people who are not as familiar with the project or a
    particular feature as you.

## Tests

We don't need 100% test coverage, but we should at least have:

  * Unit tests for all regression bugs.
  * Unit or integration tests for complex, fragile, or important functionality.

## Releases

  * When the changelog for a release gets sufficiently long (half a page to a
    page) or major features or fixes are implemented, tag a release.
